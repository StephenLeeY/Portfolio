    <h1>Project: Personas & Storyboarding</h1>
    <div class="Intro">
      This is a school project for CSCI 1300 where I take a public interface
      and create personas and a storyboard for it. My chosen interface was an
      <b>excercise bike</b> and I interviewed 3 people in order to create the
      personas.

      <h2>Part 1: Preparation</h2>
      <h3>Prepared Questions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Was the device physically uncomfortable to use?</li>
        <li>Where do you think you should put your hands and feet?</li>
        <li>What are your first impressions of the interface?</li>
        <li>Are there any parts of the interface that confuse you?</li>
        <li>Would your ideal interface have more or less buttons?</li>
        <li>
          [Follow-up to #5]
          <div class="DepQ">
            <ol type="a">
              <li>If answered “more”: What buttons do you think should be added?</li>
              <li>If answered “less”: What buttons do you think should be removed?</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>Is there anything else that you wish I had asked you in this interview?</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Sketch of Device</h3>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BHDLN8F/Device-Sketch.png" alt="Device Sketch">
      <p>
        The device is a stationary bicycle meant to help people get exercise
        indoors. The intended method in using it is to sit down on the chair
        and move the foot pedals as you would an actual bike. The screen/interface
        conveys information about speed, calories burnt, etc. while also
        controlling the force needed to move the foot pedals.

      <h2>Part 2: Recording Observations</h2>
      <h3>Observations</h3>
      <p>
        At first, the complexity of the device intimidates everyone and they spend
        a little bit observing the device. However, everyone understands that they
        should sit in the chair, put their feet in the pedals, and the arms on the
        grips. After sitting down, the first thing that they notice is the screen.
        Everyone’s first reaction is to try to turn on the device by pressing a
        power button of some sort. After being unable to find such a button, they
        press one of the option buttons that they think would turn it on. The
        button pressed is different for everyone but does not matter as all of the
        buttons turn the device on. The device turns on and they spend some time
        reading the interface. After that, they start pedalling and observing the
        changes on the screen. Some tried pressing the resistance plus button
        afterwards, but some did not most likely because the interface was
        intimidating.
      </p>
      <h3>Answer Summary</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The device was slightly uncomfortable to use. The mesh chair and the
          position of the interface are points to work on.
        </li>
        <li>
          The same way you would use a bicycle, feet on the foot pedals and hands
          on the arm grips.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generally negative. Many felt the interface lacked key components and
          was not modern.
        </li>
        <li>
          The interface was confusing. Too many buttons that aren’t clear enough
          on their purpose, and the screen was not reactive.
        </li>
        <li>Unanimous consensus for less buttons.</li>
        <li>
          Some felt almost all the buttons should be removed. Some felt the
          components on the screen itself should be reduced and simplified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Suggestions were related to specific inconveniences they had like
          adjustability of the chair or readability of specific buttons.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Part 3: Personas</h2>
      <h3>Persona 1: Busy Brad</h3>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/YkphZHM/emp1.png" alt="Empathy Map 1">
      <div class="Image_Description">
        <b>Description:</b> Busy Brad is a busy young adult with lots of things to
        do all the time. He has experience with technology and wants things to be
        quick and efficient. <br>
        <b>Problems:</b> The bike’s interface had too many buttons which
        immediately annoyed Brad because he just wants to get straight to
        exercising. The interface was unconventional in that there was no power
        button or many of the usual designs you’d see in a smartphone or computer,
        which confused Brad. <br>
        <b>User Representation:</b> Busy Brad represents the majority of the young
        users, having lots of experience using things like smartphones and
        computers. He has expectations of how interfaces should be laid out and
        gets frustrated and confused when they don’t follow conventions. Brad is
        not alone in being impatient and easily irritable when devices waste his
        time, though it is perhaps a little exaggerated. He will always look for
        shortcuts and skip things if possible. Brad, like many young users, also
        knows how to use the internet to search up how things work if need be.

      <h3>Persona 2: Mama Margaret</h3>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/wBxYfwT/emp2.png" alt="Empathy Map 2">
      <div class="Image_Description">
        <b>Description:</b> Mama Margaret is a mother in her 40s/50s that lives
        with her 2 teenage sons and her husband. She is technologically challenged
        and prefers simplicity over efficiency. <br>
        <b>Problems:</b> The interface of the bike had too many buttons with too
        little information, which overwhelmed Mama Margaret. Furthermore, the bike
        lacked the ability to adjust the position of the chair and the interface,
        which made using the bike uncomfortable given Mama Margaret’s back and neck
        problems. <br>
        <b>User Representation:</b> Mama Margaret represents the vast number of
        older users that want easy and convenient access to exercise at home. Like
        Mama Margaret, many older users are not technologically savvy and have
        higher requirements for physical comfort in their older age. However,
        these older users often have access to help from family or spouses, which
        is why Margaret is a mother that lives with her husband and children.
