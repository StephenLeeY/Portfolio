        <h2 class="display-4 text-center" id="label">Usability Principles</h2>
        <p class="lead text-center">
          The 3 main usability principles I learned in this class was
          <b>Learnabililty</b>, <b>Usability</b>, and <b>Memorability</b>. <br><br>

          First, I tackled <b>learnability</b> by creating a clear visual hierarchy.
          Utilizing a color theme and the knowledge that users typically navigate
          top to bottom and left to right was key in knowing where to put my filter
          and sorting options. I made sure the navbar was in a different color scheme
          to stand out and had clear rectangular containers for filters ordered
          in importance from top to bottom. <br><br>

          Second, I tackled <b>usability</b> by making sure all the interactive
          components are clearly marked as interactible and all the components
          have distinctive colors from their background. One example of this was
          to add + and - buttons to the top right of item cards, even when the entire
          card was clickable. Another example was changing the card's color to
          dark pink to avoid it blending in with the light pink background. <br><br>

          Finally, I tackled <b>memorability</b> by keeping things as simple and
          consistent as possible. All the tabs functioned the same way and adding
          or removing cards was as simple as clicking the cards. It was clear
          how things functioned as the application was immediately responsive in
          showing the cart at all times.
